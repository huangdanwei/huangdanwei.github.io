			<h2>
                Sedimentation
			</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
                The most significant cause of reef degradation in Singapore is sedimentation. Land reclamation, dredging of shipping channels and dumping of earth spoils, have increased the sediment load over the past six decades. Loss of coral reefs to land reclamation have occurred along the southwest coast of the mainland and on several of the offshore southern islands.<br>
                <br>

            Increased sedimentation has affected the remaining reefs in two ways -  by causing a slow but steady reduction in live coral cover, and reducing the lower depth limit of coral growth on reef slopes. Surveys since 1986 indicate that live coral cover has decreased by up to 20% on some reefs, although other reefs register no impact. The reduction in sunlight penetration has furthermore reduced the lower depth limit of coral growth. In the 1970s, coral growth extended to 10 m down the reef slope. Today, reef and coral growth is restricted to 8 m.

            The high turbidity of our waters restrict light penetration and reef life ends at a depth of only 12 m, marking the lower growth limit for reef-building corals. Sedimentation rates ranged from 3 to 6 mg cm-2 day-1 in 1979. In 1994, these increased to 5-45 mg cm-2 day-1 (the higher value obtained from localised areas close to reclamation projects). This reduced visibility from 10 m in the 1960s to 2 m or less today. As a consequence, the reef is very compact, as opposed to reefs in clear waters, which can be found at depths of 20 m and more.

            Given the limited visibility in local waters, one might expect rising sea levels to also impact coral populations here. Rising waters decrease the amount of light available at lower depths, which drive coral diversity and communities. Surprisingly, as corals on Singapore’s lower reef slopes have been found to mostly be adaptable generalists, they are unlikely to be impacted by light limitation from sea level rise.<br>

			<h2>
				Climate change
			</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
            As with coral reefs around the world, Singapore reefs suffered a mass bleaching event in June 1998, June 2010, and again during the global bleaching event from 2014-2017. Sea temperatures around Pulau Hantu and St John's Island were elevated by 1-2 degrees C from March to June 1998. 50-90% of all reef organisms in Singapore were affected, particularly the hard corals, soft corals and anemones. The bleaching effect extended to 6 m, the lower growth depth limit for coral growth locally. Sea temperatures returned to normal in August 1998. A study of the stressed colonies was undertaken during this period. 10 out of 35 coral colonies died from the stress, and the soft coral Sinularia and hard coral Euphyllia were most affected. Other colonies showed various signs of stress, such as growth of turf algae and silt accumulation, leading to partial mortality.

            The bleaching event in 2010 had a less severe impact on corals in Singapore compared with other countries. Severe effects were rarely seen among coral colonies, with a few genera remaining unaffected. However, the subsequent bleaching in 2016 bleached more than half of all coral, with certain sites seeing significant decreases in coral cover and community changes for months.<br>

            <h2>
                Oil spills
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Accidental oil spills remain an ever-present threat. The Straits of Singapore is considered to be a hotspot for oil spills, with at least eight major spills since 1972. Oil components can both toxify the water and combine with sediment to smother coral. However the 1997 Evoikos oil spill (27,000 tonnes) did not seriously affect coral reefs, although oil contaminated the upper parts of some reef flats.<br>

            <h2>
                Recreational activities
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Other activities that also have an impact on the reefs include recreational and tourist-related use. Negligent or inexperienced divers without proper buoyancy control leave a trail of broken corals. Anchor damage is caused by fishing boats and pleasure craft.<br>
